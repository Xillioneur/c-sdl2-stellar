# C SDL2 Stellar

A game about space exploration and God as space and planets. Amen and good day.

## Episode 4 - Stellar

This won't hurt to explore as the game is now more complicated than before, haha. 
We are now almost at 1,000 lines of code for a game that we are exploring. 
Get ready for one that will be 1,500 lines of code. And one that will be 2,000 lines 
of code total. Hopefully it works out. Will have to see what happens with Grok and how it supports big games. Maybe I'll move to a codebase based AI that will help me code an entire codebase for free. This is good for now. Check it out. We made it together for free in the span of a few hours.

```bash
gcc main.c -o game.o -lSDL2 -lm && ./game.o
```
